# ASTROCAT - Community Puzzle Game Requirements

## Project Overview
ASTROCAT is an isometric puzzle game inspired by Q*bert, built for Reddit's Community Games Hackathon. The game features user-generated content where players can create, share, and play community levels through Reddit's Devvit platform.

## User Stories (EARS Notation)

AND deselect previously selected block with fade-out animation
AND update cursor preview to show selected block type

**US-02: Block Placement**
WHEN user clicks on valid grid position with block type selected
